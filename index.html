        <div id="text"> [Verse 1] She was a shark smile in a yellow van She came around and I stole her glance In my youth, a vampire Evelyn shown quiet as roses sting It came over me at a bad time But who wouldn't ride on a moonlit line? I had her in my eye, 85 down the road of a dead end gleam [Chorus] And she said woo Baby, take me And I said woo Baby, take me too [Verse 2] It came over her at a bad time Riding through Winona down the dotted line Held us gunning out 90 miles down the road of a dead end dream She looked over with her part smile Caught up in the twinkle, it could take a while And the money pile on the dashboard fluttering [Chorus] And she said woo Baby, take me And I said woo Baby, take me too [Verse 3] Evelyn's kiss was oxygen I leaned over to take it in As we went howling through the edge of south Des Moines It came over me at a bad time She burned over the double line And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guard rail Ooh the guard rail Ooh the guard rail [Chorus] And she said woo Baby, take me And I said woo Baby, take me too And she said woo Baby, take me And I said woo Baby, take me too </div>
